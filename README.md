# Contact Picker Twilio Client

This application is an example of the Contact Picker API for the web being used in conjuction with [Twilio Client](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/client/javascript) to make phone calls from the browser.

_Note:_ The Contact Picker API is currently only supported in Chrome 80 on Android M and later. To see this in action you will need to test with an Android device.

## Running this application

You will need a few things to run this application.

Install the dependencies:

| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID   | Your Twilio Account SID from [the Twilio console](https://www.twilio.com/console/)                                                      |

### Configuring your TwiML App

A [TwiML App](https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/twiml/apps) is a collection of webhook URLs. For this application we only need a voice request URL. Since we will be running this application locally and tunnelling through to it with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) you should start up ngrok pointing to port 3000:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Take note of the ngrok URL and enter it, with the path `/voice` as the voice request URL for a new TwiML app. The URL entirely should be:

```
https://YOUR_NGROK_SUBDOMAIN.ngrok.io/voice
```

Save the TwiML App and enter the SID in the `.env` file.

### Start the application

Run the application with:

```bash
npm start
```

And visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app in action.
